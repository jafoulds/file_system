# uvic_file_system_image

### By Jared Foulds

These three C programs implement operations on a uVic file-system image. 
The operations are: 
(1) printing information about a disk image (statuvfs)
(2) printing a directory listing of files in a disk image (lsuvfs)
(3) outputting the contents of a file in disk image to the host consoleâ€™s stdout stream (catuvfs)
